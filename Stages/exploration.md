## Ownership
- Accountable : Product Development Executive / Product Manager / Product Owner
- Responsible : Product Development Researcher

## Objective
- Establishing the viability of the [Value Opportunity][oppo]
- Identifying Stakeholders
- Creating an initial [Value Case][valcase]

## Input
- [Value Opportunity][oppo]

## Methods
As a [LeanUP](/Overview/leanup.md) practitioner, you can use a multitude of brainstorming techniques to explore the [value opportunity][oppo]. Collaborative canvas mapping is an especially useful approach, for instance using Roman Pichler's [Product Vision Board](https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-product-vision-board/).

Additionally, Creating [Job Stories](https://www.intercom.com/blog/using-job-stories-design-features-ui-ux/) can be helpful. Job stories help people to imagine a better way of working. They're concise, so they fit well in a LEAN product development process.

| - | - |
| **When** | Any Situation Someone's in |
| **I Want To** | Motivation for Action |
| **so I can** | Envisioned Outcome |


Also, creating a product positioning statement, a tried and proven technique from the Rational Unified Process, helps to outline the opportunity at hand. As an example:

| | |
| - | - |
| **For** | Any Digital Organization |
| **Who** | Practices Agile Digital Product Development |
| **LeanUP** | Is a useful guide |
| **That** | Merges LEAN principles with the Unified Process |
| **Unlike** | Either the Rational Unified Process or Scaling Agile initiatives |
| **Our Product** | Brings a risk-driven, well-governed approach to LEAN/Agile product development while driving the Waste out of the Unified Process |

## Outcome
- Viability of the [Value Opportunity][oppo] has been established
- If viable, then 
  - the priority of the [Value Opportunity][oppo] has been defined. This requires insight into the *urgency* of the opportunity and into its *business potential*.
  - the initial [Value Case][valcase] has been accepted
  - the [risk list][risks] is updated

## Failure Risk Reduction 
During Exploration, the focus is on ensuring that all the resources required to complete the product are sufficiently known, and reasonably available. This includes the estimated budget and the (key) human resources. A High-Level design is often required to answer the key questions for the stage. At a minimum, the chosen interface style must be known.

## Decision
Based on the findings, the Product Development Researcher makes a recommendation to the Product Accountable. The Product Accountable decides whether to include the proposed product on the product development plan.
