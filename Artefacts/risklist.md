A Risk List is a tool to manage the product development risks. It must be updated at every stage change, at a minimum. Usually, it's a simple table, used to track the progress of risk mitigation.

Do refrain from nominating every issue as a risk. A risk is a threat to deliver a committed result that is in need of intervention of a principle to remediate. That's it. Once remediated, or simply accepted by the principle, the risks gets archived. 

Anyone can raise a risk, but the risk is only managed when an owner is appointed. The owner will mostly require backing from a principle before accepting the risk.

| Nr | Title | Likelihood | Impact | Severity | Owner | Principle | State | Summary |

As summary, the following template may be used.
> As a risk owner, I am no longer confident to my commitment of ..., because of ..., which might impact budget/timelines/security/feasibility ..., unless ...
