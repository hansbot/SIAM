# The Lean Unified Process Model

Unlike the original [Unified Process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_process), which is project oriented, the [Lean Unified Process][lup] is product oriented. Thereby, it is closer aligned to modern agile frameworks. It also aligns with the widespread belief that APIs should be managed as a product. 

Similar to the original [Unified Process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_process), the Lean Unified Process defines 4 distinct increments. known as *stages*. These stages are designed to rapidly drive down risks, and fail early when necessary.

| # | Phase | Purpose | Trigger |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1 | [Exploration](/Stages/exploration.md) | Alignment | [Business Opportunity](/Stages/bus-oppo.md) |
| 2 | [Inception](/Stages/inception.md) | Scoping | [Business Case](/Stages/bus-case.md) |
| 3 | [Elaboration](/Stages/elaboration.md) | Design | [Development Case](/Stages/dev-case.md) |
| 4 | [Delivery](/Stages/delivery.md) | Working Software | Accepted Prototype |

Notice that the [Inception](/Stages/inception.md) stage is preceeded by an [Exploration](/Stages/exploration.md) phase. This is an essential addition to the process. It is where the product gets shaped. The Construction and Transition phases have been merged into a single [Delivery](/Stages/delivery.md) phase. This aligns with the Agile way of working, sometimes summarized in the principle "You build it, you run it". It allows for a highly iterative devops approach, resulting in "continuous delivery". It also recognizes that an API is never finished unless the last consumer is retired.

The "disciplines" in the original are replaced with 6 Core Capabilities. 
- [API Governance](/Capabilities/governance.md)
- [API Ownership](/Capabilities/ownership.md)
- [API Design](/Capabilities/design.md)
- [API Engineering](/Capabilities/engineering.md)
- [API Management](/Capabilities/management.md)
- [API Security](/Capabilities/security.md)

Notice that the prefix [API](/api.md) here defines what makes the process Lean, by focussing on Interfaces rather than the insides of a bounded context. This opens the door for a more informal way of working during the delivery phase. The [Lean Unified Process][lup] just sets the guardrails and controls the boundaries.
